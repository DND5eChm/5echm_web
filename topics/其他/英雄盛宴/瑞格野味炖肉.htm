<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>The frozen and unforgiving tundra of Faer?n's North are 
tested by a brave few and tamed by nearly none. However, the Reghed barbarians, 
a collection of hardy and superstitious totem-based nomadic tribes, wander the 
lands with comparable ease, harnessing its sparse potential for the benefit of 
their relatively small clans. To endure the arduous cold of Icewind Dale, the 
Reghed and other similar groups, such as the Uthgardt of Northern Faer?n, must 
maximize time and energy to thrive. Communal meals at winter camps (constructed 
seasonally to survive the exceptionally long winter) are as central to their 
dignified warrior culture as their deep religious traditions. Venison (the meat 
of antelope, deer, or elk) is the most readily available, and thus coveted, 
finding various uses for these resourceful nomads, but beef or rothé is 
completely acceptable in other realms. One ceremonial dish (to which the Reghed 
stake proud claim) that marks the beginning of the long winter is pot roast. A 
tender flank of beast, chunks of dried apricots, halved gold potatoes, and 
branches of seasonal herbs intermingle with the natural wild meat juices to make 
this an especially aromatic and practical single-course meal.</P>

       Dry the beef with paper towels, tie it into a uniform 
shape with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, and sprinkle generously with salt 
and pepper.<BR>In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of 
the oil until shimmering. Add the beef and cook, undisturbed, until deeply 
browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the beef a quarter turn and continue 
cooking, until well browned on each of the remaining three sides, about 10 
minutes more; adjust the heat if the bottom of the pot threatens to burn. 
Transfer the beef to a large

       Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 
tablespoon oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the onion, bay 
leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the 
pot occasionally, until the onion begins to soften and releases some liquid, 
about 4 minutes. Add the paprika and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for 2 
minutes more. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1

       Nestle the beef (and any accumulated juices) into the pot 
(the liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the meat). Cover the pot, 
transfer it to the oven, and cook for 1又3/4 hours. Then add the carrots, 
potatoes, and halved apricots, nestling them into the liquid. Cover the pot, 
return to the oven, and continue to cook until the beef is extremely tender (a 
paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and it registers 200°F on an 
instant-read thermometer, 21/4 to 23/4 hours

       Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large 
slotted spoon, spoon the carrots, potatoes, onion, and apricot halves to a 
serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated 
liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup; remove and discard the bay leaves 
and thyme sprigs. Reserve the garlic. Let the liquid rest until the fat rises to 
the surface, about 10 minutes. If using a fat separator, pour the liquid into 
another container; if using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow 
soup spoon to skim fat off the surface and discard it (the liquid will be thick, 
and there may not be much fat at the

skins and mash them to a paste with a fork. Stir the garlic and most of the

       Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the 
grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces) and sprinkle it 
very lightly with salt and pepper. Place the meat on the platter with the 
vegetables and apricots, pour the gravy over the meat, sprinkle with the 
remaining parsley, and

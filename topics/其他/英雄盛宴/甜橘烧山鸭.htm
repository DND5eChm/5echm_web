<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>Dwarves are widely renowned for their "unsweet tooth," but 
that doesn't deny them good taste, as evidenced by the southern Faerunian gold 
dwarves' affinity for orange and persimmon mountain duck. The uniquely 
hot-and-tart sauce brightens the succulent gamey meat and yields a divine 
duck-skin treat. Perhaps years of living near humans wore them down or broadened 
their palate, but it is said modern dwarves have actually come to blows over the 
coveted crispy skin alone! While this dish might not grace the subterranean 
banquet halls of days long gone, it is surely on the surface dwarf menus of 
today.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>4人份用料</FONT></STRONG><BR>3 or 
  4 oranges, preferably navels<BR>4 boneless duck breast halves (about 8 ounces 
  each)<BR>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<BR>1 shallot, minced<BR>1 
  teaspoon minced fresh thyme<BR>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth<BR>1又1/2 
  tablespoons honey<BR>1又1/2 tablespoons brandy or cognac<BR>Pinch of 
  cayenne<BR>1 tablespoon unsalted butter<BR>2 tablespoons chopped fresh 
  parsley<BR>1 firm-ripe Fuyu persimmon, peeled and diced into neat 1/4-inch 
  pieces (optional)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from one of the oranges and 
set aside. Cut the peel and pith off the zested and a second orange. Working 
over a strainer set in a bowl, separate the orange segments. Discard any seeds 
and reserve the segments. Shake the strainer so all the juice drips into the 
bowl; pour the juice into a measuring cup. If necessary, squeeze one or both of 
the remaining oranges for enough juice to equal 2/3 cup and then set 
aside.<BR>Preheat the oven to 200°F with the rack in the middle of the oven. 
With a sharp paring knife, cut four or five diagonal slashes in the skin on each 
duck breast half, taking care to cut down to, but not into, the flesh. Dry the 
halves well and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.</P>
<P>Place the duck breasts skin-side down in a large nonstick 
skillet, set the skillet over medium heat, and cook, undisturbed, until most of 
the fat is rendered (if necessary, pour or spoon the fat out of the skillet 
occasionally) and the skin is deeply browned and crisp, 12 to 14 minutes, 
adjusting the heat, if necessary, to prevent scorching. Turn the halves 
skin-side up and continue cooking, undisturbed, until an instant-read 
thermometer in the thickest part registers about 125°F for medium-rare or 130° 
to 135°F for medium, 2 to 8 minutes more. Transfer the duck to a heatproof 
plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to rest and keep warm, 
about 5 minutes.</P>
<P>Pour or spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the 
skillet. Return the skillet to medium-low heat, add the shallot, thyme, and 1/2 
teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add the orange 
juice, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring 
occasionally, until the consistency is slightly syrupy and the juice is reduced 
by half, about 4 minutes.</P>
<P>Add the broth and any accumulated duck juices to the 
skillet, return to a simmer, and simmer vigorously, stirring occasionally, until 
the consistency is slightly syrupy and the volume is reduced by half, 3 to 4 
minutes more. Adjust the heat to medium-low and add the honey, brandy, cayenne, 
and reserved orange zest. Simmer, stirring, to melt and incorporate the honey 
and brandy, about 1 minute more. Add the butter and stir constantly while it 
melts and incorporates into the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with 
additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add most of the parsley and stir to 
incorporate. Pour or spoon about half of the sauce onto a warm serving 
plate.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, diagonally cut each duck breast half into 
1/2-inch slices. Fan the slices over the sauce, top with the reserved orange 
segments, persimmon (if using), and the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with the 
remaining parsley and serve hot.</P></body>

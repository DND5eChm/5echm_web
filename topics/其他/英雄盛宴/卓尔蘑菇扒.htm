<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>卓尔蘑菇扒 Drow Mushroom Steaks</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>Adelicacy of the great Underdark City of Spiders, 
Menzoberranzan, these seasoned ripplebark mushroom steaks are harvested fresh 
from the fungi fields near Lake Donigarten. While their exact agronomy is a 
closely guarded drow secret, many speculate that fertilizer from the Donigarten 
island rothé make these mushrooms grow unusually large, meaty, and nutrient 
rich. They're so tasty and chewy, you'll think you are eating unicorn! This dish 
has become so popular that it has migrated to the surface, and it's even rumored 
to be a favorite of Xanathar of Waterdeep, a notorious beholder who prefers it 
to surface-grown mushrooms as well as raw meat. But make sure to carefully read 
the label on that bottle of balsamic vinegarthe drow are as famous for their 
poisons as their sauces.</P>

  tablespoons olive oil<BR>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<BR>2 tablespoons

<P>In a shallow dish wide enough to hold the mushrooms in a 
single layer, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, 
thyme, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Put the mushrooms in the dish. Set 
aside to marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes, turning the mushrooms over 
and spooning the marinade on them halfway through.<BR>Heat an outdoor grill or 
indoor grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the mushrooms, flipping to cook 
both sides, until tender and browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot or at room 
temperature.</P></body>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>变体规则 Variant Rules</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>（没人翻译）</P>
<P>A shared campaign might use some variant rules to handle 
certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers League, for instance, has variant 
systems for gaining levels and acquiring treasure. These "house rules," 
presented below, serve as a sort of common language, ensuring that the rewards 
all characters receive are equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a 
character experienced.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>角色提升 Character 
Advancement</FONT></STRONG><BR>In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not 
by accumulating experience points but by reaching experience checkpoints. This 
system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play 
session.</P>
<P>A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an 
adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is based on the adventure's 
projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table. The 
reward for completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 2 
checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours playing through it.</P>
<P>If a character completes an adventure designed for a tier 
higher than the character's current tier, the character is awarded 1 additional 
checkpoint. For example, if a 2nd-level character completes a 6th-level 
adventure designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 checkpoints.</P>
<P>Playing time might seem like an odd way to measure 
experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with how a shared campaign is 
meant to work. A character played for 10 hours reaches the same number of 
checkpoints, whether the character went up against a dragon or spent all that 
time lurking in a pub. This approach ensures that a player's preferred style is 
neither penalized nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and 
social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to 
avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>使用记录点 Using 
Checkpoints</FONT></STRONG><BR>The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next 
level depends on a character's level:</P>
<P>At levels 1–4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to 
advance to the next level.<BR>At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is 
needed to advance to the next level.<BR>At the end of a play session, characters 
must level up if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The required 
number of checkpoints is expended, and any remaining checkpoints are applied 
toward the next opportunity for advancement.</P>
<P><FONT color=#800000 size=5><STRONG></STRONG></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#800000 size=5><STRONG>个人宝藏 Individual 
Treasure</STRONG></FONT><BR>In a shared campaign, each character receives a 
fixed number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level. (This gain represents the 
treasure a character might find in a standard adventure.)</P>
<P>As an additional benefit, characters are not required to 
put out gold to maintain a lifestyle. Instead, each character begins with a 
modest lifestyle, which improves as the character attains higher levels.</P>
<P>These benefits are summarized on the Individual Treasure 
table. Ways for characters to spend their treasure are covered in the "Buying 
and Selling" section below.</P>
<P>Individual Treasure<BR>Level

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>魔法物品 Magic 
Items</FONT></STRONG><BR>Characters earn treasure points from adventures, then 
redeem those points in exchange for magic items. The list of available magic 
items is agreed to and compiled by the DMs running the campaign.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>获取财宝点 
</FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Gaining Treasure 
Points</FONT></STRONG><BR>Each character earns treasure points based on an 
adventure's tier and its intended playing time:</P>
<P>1 treasure point is awarded for every 2 hours played in a 
tier 1 or tier 2 adventure.<BR>1 treasure point is awarded for every 1 hour 
played in a tier 3 or tier 4 adventure.<BR>As with the variant rules for gaining 
levels, this award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather 
than the actual time a group spent at the table.</P>
<P>If a character completes an adventure of a tier higher 
than that character's tier, the character receives 1 additional treasure point 
for that adventure.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>创建物品列表 Creating an Item 
List</FONT></STRONG><BR>The DMs of the shared campaign should work together to 
compile a list of magic items that players can purchase. The magic item tables 
in chapter 2 of this book and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the 
obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow or ban is a matter of 
personal preference, just as it is for the DM in a standard campaign. Involving 
all the DMs helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expectations. When in 
doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add it to the available items at a later 
time than it would be to remove it from the game once it has been handed 
out.</P>
<P>Naturally, the list of available items is longer for 
adventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those higher-tier items 
likewise increases. The Magic Items by Tier table provides the details.</P>
<P>For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure can 
be spent on items from tables A, B, C, and F. Any item on the first three tables 
costs 4 points, and an item from table F costs 8 points.</P>
<P><STRONG>Magic Items by Tier<BR>Magic Item 
Table&nbsp;Available at Tiers&nbsp;Point 
Cost</STRONG><BR>A&nbsp;1–4&nbsp;4<BR>B&nbsp;1–4&nbsp;4<BR>C&nbsp;1–4&nbsp;4<BR>D&nbsp;2–4&nbsp;8<BR>E&nbsp;3–4&nbsp;8<BR>F&nbsp;1–4&nbsp;8<BR>G&nbsp;2–4&nbsp;10<BR>H&nbsp;3–4&nbsp;10<BR>I&nbsp;3–4&nbsp;12</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>消耗财宝点 Spending Treasure 
Points</FONT></STRONG><BR>Players must spend treasure points at the end of a 
play session, immediately after determining whether their characters have gained 
a level. The order of these steps is important, since a character might enter a 
new tier because of the level gain.</P>
<P>Players are entitled to choose any approved item from one 
of the magic item tables available in the current tier. Treasure points can be 
spread across multiple items.</P>
<P>Many items cost more treasure points than a character can 
earn in a 2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy such an item, a character can make a 
deposit, spending treasure points on the item until it's paid off, at which time 
the character gains the item.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>买入与卖出 Buying and 
Selling<BR></FONT></STRONG>Characters can use their monetary treasure to 
purchase anything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the Player's 
Handbook. In addition, the Adventurers League allows characters to purchase 
potions and spell scrolls, as detailed below. A spell scroll can be purchased 
only by a character who is capable of casting the spell in question.</P>

Items</FONT></STRONG><BR>In a shared campaign, characters are not entitled to 
sell items they find on adventures or equipment they purchase with their 
personal funds. Weapons, armor, and other gear used by enemies are considered 
too damaged to have any monetary value.</P></body>

<H2>Province of Druskenvald</H2>
<P>As with any folktale, and especially within the genre of Folk Horror, the 
heart of the story can be found in the land itself, with the setting becoming a 
major character in its own right. In this section, you will discover the 
thirteen primary provinces of Druskenvald, the people who call them home, and 
how the unique aspects of each region affect the nightly life of the locals. In 
addition to major features and pieces of folklore of each province, you’ll gain 
a deeper understanding of its ruler, the witch of the Midnight Moon that 
terrorizes its people, and notable locations rife with opportunities for 
haunting adventures.The forthcoming province overviews are intended to serve as 
inspiration and guidance for crafting your own adventures in Druskenvald that 
range across a wide variety of environments, challenges, and themes. The minor 
province of Wickermoor Hollow, unrecognized by the ruling authority of the 
Crescent Court, is featured and heavily detailed in this book’s adventure 
campaign, The Crooked Moon (see chapters 8–26)</P>

<H2>Potion Brewing（翻译暂缺）</H2>
<P>Magic abounds on Obojima. It permeates the landscape, and it pools in certain 
objects. Over the generations, sages discovered that this latent magic can be 
unleashed through what has become the honored craft of potion brewing. The craft 
is mysterious, wondrous, and more than a bit chaotic. Most people don't even 
attempt it. Seasoned brewers can't be entirely certain about what kind of potion 
will result when combining ingredients. Even so, the tradition remains among the 
island's proudest.</P>
<P>This chapter discusses how to gather ingredients, how to brew potions, and 
what kind of potions one can make.</P>

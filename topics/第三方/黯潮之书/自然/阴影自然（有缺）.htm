<H2>The Nature of Shadow（翻译暂缺）</H2>
<P>The foremost questions from many travelers to the Shadow Realm have to do 
with its shadow matter, its malleable nature, and how humans and other 
intelligent species survive in such a strange place. To natives, these questions 
are foolish, for the laws of nature may be different than they are on other 
planes or in the mortal realm, but the Shadow Realm is hospitable to those who 
take time to learn its ways. This chapter provides that foundation.</P>
<P>While it is known for its occasionally warped, echoed locations with 
parallels in the mortal world, the Shadow Realm also harbors twisted plants, 
animals, monsters, conditions of travel, and even strange laws of nature worth 
closer inspection. Turn your gaze to the mutable lands of shadow, and pray you 
have a keen eye to see what marvels they contain.</P>
<P>编注：本章节仅翻译了新增的状态，其余部分翻译暂缺</P>

<P>The dragonborn race in the Player's Handbook is the most 
direct way to reflect a character with dragons somewhere far back in their 
ancestry. But for players who want to try a more nuanced approach, this section 
offers three variant dragonborn race options that can be used to create a 
character with clear connections to a specific draconic ancestry. When you're 
making a new character using one of these races, use the rules under "Creating 
Your Character" to fill out the details.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Creating Your 
Character</FONT></STRONG><BR>When you create your D&amp;D character, you decide 
whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's 
fantastical races. If you select one of the dragonborn races in this chapter, 
follow these additional rules during character creation.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Ability Score 
Increases</FONT></STRONG><BR>When determining your character's ability scores, 
increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or 
increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method 
you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.</P>
<P>The "Quick Build" section for your character's class 
offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those 
suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of 
the scores can be raised above 20.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Languages</FONT></STRONG><BR>Your character can speak, read, and 
write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate 
for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages 
to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a 
particular campaign.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Creature 
Type</FONT></STRONG><BR>Every creature in D&amp;D, including every player 
character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature 
they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option 
presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.</P>
<P>Here's a list of the game's creature types in 
alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, 
Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't 
have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain 
types in different ways. For example, the cure wounds spell doesn't work on a 
Construct or an Undead.</P></body>

<P>This chapter is intended for the Dungeon Master. The 
ideas and tables herein can help inspire you as you prepare to use dragons in 
your D&amp;D game, whether you're building a single climactic encounter or 
planning a whole campaign around these marvelous creatures. The material here 
builds on what's in the Dungeon Master's Guide and the "Dragons" section of the 
Monster Manual. It's divided into five main sections:</P>
<P><STRONG>"Roleplaying Dragons"</STRONG> presents tips and 
tricks for building a dragon character as complex and distinctive as any other 
villain, ally, or mysterious figure in your campaign. It includes tables to help 
you craft dragon personalities, as well as discussions of dragon aging, 
reproduction, and death; dragons' relationship to undeath and religion; and 
draconic shape-shifting and organizations.</P>
<P><STRONG>"Followers"</STRONG> explores the relationships 
between dragons and the various creatures that might serve their interests.</P>
<P><STRONG>"Dragon Encounters"</STRONG> offers suggestions 
for building encounters that feature dragons, whether you want such an encounter 
to be the climax of an adventure or an obstacle in a larger narrative.</P>
<P><STRONG>"Dragon Adventures"</STRONG> looks at the 
different roles a dragon can play in an adventure's story.</P>
<P><STRONG>"Dragon Campaigns"</STRONG> talks about building 
worlds and campaign story arcs that put dragons at the forefront of history and 
at the center of the characters' lives and adventuring 
ambitions.</P></body>
